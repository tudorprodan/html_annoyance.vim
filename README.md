# Html \<A\>nnoyance

This is an extra `HTML` syntax file which fixes one of vim's annoyances:  

It removes the underlining from leading and trailing whitespace in `<A>` tags.

## Warning

This works, and due to the fact that it's really small you can tell that it can't mess up too many things.

However, this is me learning vim syntax files. So if you see something that's not done right, please open an issue on GitHub about it, I'd love to hear what I could have done better.

## Manual installation

Copy `after/syntax/html.vim` to `~/.vim/after/syntax/html.vim`.

## Using pathogen

Place the content of this repository in a new bundle.  
`git clone <this_repository> ~/.vim/bundle/html_annoyance/`
