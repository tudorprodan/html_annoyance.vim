# Html \<A\>nnoyance

This is an extra `HTML` syntax file which fixes one of vim's annoyances:  

It removes the underlining from leading and trailing whitespace in `<A>` tags.

![Preview](//raw.github.com/tudorprodan/html_annoyance.vim/master/preview.png)


## Manual installation

Copy `after/syntax/html.vim` to `~/.vim/after/syntax/html.vim`.

## Using pathogen

Place the content of this repository in a new bundle.  
`git clone <this_repository> ~/.vim/bundle/html_annoyance`  
\-or-  
`git submodule add <this_repo> ~/.vim/bundle/html_annoyance``

## Info

This is me learning vim syntax files.  
So if you see something that's not done right, please open an issue on GitHub about it, I'd love to hear what I could have done better.
